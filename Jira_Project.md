<h3>  1.3. Test Analysis </h3>

The testing process will be executed based on the application requirements.<b> (The requiremen ts analysis has been done in order to implement the <i> early 
testing</i>) thest principle and the results can be found here:[Jira Software(https://itfclasses.atlassian.net/projects/RSTT?
selectedItem=com.thed.zephyr.je__cycle-summary)].</b>. <br><br>

The following test conditions were found: <br>

<h3> 1.5. Test Implementation</h3>

The following elements are needed to be ready before the test execution phase begins:
<ol>
  <li> Insure the propper technological assests: offices, electricity, chairs, desks laptops, cool-air,etc.</li>
  <li> Optain the necessary informations: credentilas, website structure informations, website functionalities,etc. </li>
  <li> Optain the purpose of the website and the type of products </li>
  <li> Insure the presence and monitorazing of the task team during the project period </li>
</ol>

<h3>1.6. Test Execution </h3>

Test cases are executed on the created test Cycle summary: Rares Seresanu TM-TA10

Bugs have been created based on the failed tests. The complete bug reports can be found here: [Jira Software(https://itfclasses.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/RSTT/issues/RSTT-10?jql=project%20%3D%20%22RSTT%22%20and%20type%20%3D%20Bug%20ORDER%20BY%20created%20DESC)].</b>. <br><br>

  <li> User Doesn't Have Access To Payment Options On the Main Page.Medium; Severity:Normal </li>
</ol>

Full regression testing is needed on the impacted areas after the bugs are fixed and retesting will be done for every functionality that was previously failed.

1.7 Test Completion
As the Exit criteria were met and satisfied as mentioned in the appropriate section, this feature is suggested to ‘Go Live’ by the Testing team

The traceability matrix was generated and can be found here:
![TransabilityMatrix!](/Users/Rares/OneDrive/Dekstop/ProiectFinalTMTA/TransabilityMatrix.jpg"TransabilityMatrix")

Test execution chart was generated and can be found below: 

![RaportDashboard!](/Users/Rares/OneDrive/Dekstop/ProiectFinalTMTA/RaportDashboard.jpg"RaportDashboard")

The final report shows that a number 10 tests have failed of a total of 0 tests.

A number of 2 total bugs were found, from which the priority is mediun for 2 bugs and high for 0.

During this testing, all 10 test cases planned for execution were tested. From the 10 test cases, two bugs were discovered, with medium priority and normal 
severity. Product risks have been reduced by upgrading the application. Retesting and regression testing will be performed for a new version of the application.
